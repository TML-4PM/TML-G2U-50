# 🦁 WildLifeShield - World's Deadliest Animals Insurance 🦈

## 🚀 Welcome to WildLifeShield!

Congratulations, fearless adventurer! You’ve stumbled upon the only insurance platform that actually acknowledges that **Mother Nature wants you dead.** Whether you’re swimming with sharks, trekking through snake-infested jungles, or just unlucky enough to get chased by a crocodile on holiday—**we've got you covered!**

## 🛠️ What is This?
WildLifeShield is an **e-commerce site** where you can purchase **wildlife-specific insurance plans** to protect yourself against the unexpected (and honestly, sometimes expected) wrath of nature.

## 🦍 Insurance Plans We Offer
For the low price of **$9.99 per policy**, you can secure yourself against:

✔ **Shark Attack Insurance** – Because sharks aren’t impressed by your snorkeling skills.  
✔ **Snake Bite Insurance** – Good for when you find out the "stick" you just picked up is actually a highly venomous death noodle.  
✔ **Big Cat Encounter Insurance** – Lions, tigers, leopards—oh my!  
✔ **Crocodile Attack Insurance** – You thought Steve Irwin made it look easy, didn’t you?  
✔ **Bear Encounter Insurance** – Just in case "playing dead" doesn’t actually work.  
✔ **Deadly Insect Bite Insurance** – Because even the little ones can ruin your trip.  
✔ **And more!**

### 🎁 Want to save money?
Get **ALL policies for just $35!** (a.k.a. the "I Like Living" package)  

## 🛒 Features of the Site
💳 **Stripe-Integrated Payments** – Because handing over a bag of gold coins is no longer socially acceptable.  
📜 **Create Your Own Policy** – Got a weirdly specific fear? We’ll insure it (for $9.99).  
📸 **Share Your Animal Encounter Stories** – Whether it’s a close call or just an embarrassing tale, the WildLifeShield community wants to hear it.  
📈 **Leaderboard & Badges** – Earn **rewards for surviving encounters** (or just for being paranoid enough to get insured).  
🌓 **Dark Mode** – So you can browse in style, even while hiding in a tree from a bear.  

## 📦 How to Set Up
If you’re hosting this yourself, follow these steps:
1️⃣ **Download the files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and put them on a web server.  
2️⃣ **Deploy using Vercel, Firebase, or any static hosting platform.**  
3️⃣ **Make sure payments work with Stripe!** (Nobody likes unpaid claims.)  
4️⃣ **Enjoy living on the edge, responsibly.**

## 🛡 Security & Safety
- **User data is protected** with encryption & OAuth authentication.  
- **No payment info is stored** (so don’t even try to hack us).  
- **All policies are legally binding** (unless you attempt to wrestle a hippo—then you're on your own).
